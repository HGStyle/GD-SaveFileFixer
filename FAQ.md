# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

A.K.A. "Foire Aux Questions" (FAQ) in French. (useless fact but why not)

## it doznt workkkkk helllppp meeeee

I'm sorry, but I can't help if you just send me this.
At least send me a screenshot or a text transcription of what's on the screen, if a terminal (a black window) is opened, please report what's wrotten on it.

## Android tutorial is way too long

You wanna try to get your GD savefiles back, yes or not? It's the only way, as far as I know.

## I use BSD or Ubuntu Touch

Use Android or Linux instead. I have no idea where are the savefiles saved. Good luck.
If you have the savefiles, use [Wine](https://winehq.org/) to get a Windows environement (to get support fixing for Windows/Android-like savefiles),
or [Darling](https://darlinghq.org/) to get a Darwin (MacOS) environement (to get support for fixing MacOS/iOS-like savefiles).

## I don't wanna cancel my iDevice guarentee

Firstly, check is the guarentee still available for your device! Because maybe it's not, so you won't cancel anything.
See Apple's website: [Apple Check Coverage](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/)

## What is this for?

If you cannot open Geometry Dash, then try this. It is not guarenteed to work, but it may in 50% of time.
It fixes some weird data put by Geometry Dash in it for some reason and that the game can't handle, because
we all know that RobTop is the most unlogical programmer that ever existed.
It works on official versions from Google Play Store, Apple Store/iTunes, Microsoft Store and Steam, but also
for cracked versions and other custom versions such as unofficial versions (ex: unofficial 2.2s) or GDPSes.
