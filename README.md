# Geometry Dash Savefile Fix

This tool can fix most problems caused unable to open the game by the savefiles. (which is the game will only launch if you move the savefiles to other folders)
This is an ameliorated version of the [Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix](https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix) made by [WEGFan](https://github.com/WEGFan) but since he seems inactive now, and there are some issues opened, I wanted to help these people to dont loose their data.

## How to run

Come back a bit later, I'm doing things like apllying patches of compiling that programm.

## Not working ?

If you encounter any problem (unable to fix / doesn't work after fixed), get help by [create an issue](https://github.com/HGStyle/GD-SaveFileFixer/issues/new) or [contact me on Discord](https://dsc.gg/hgstyle) (faster response on Discord).

## More info about savefile encoding/decoding

Before, there were a Fandom Wiki page on Geometry Dash Fandom Wiki explaining that, but it has been deleted by the staff since there were not many things in it.
However, it was very usefull to me for writing that programm ! So here's a backup of that page !
